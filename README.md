# DuinoCoin miner optimized for phones under OS android or any piece of junk that can run python

To start it you can use any python ide, I suggest pydroid 3 or you can also use termux

in folder PCMiner_2.4_resources in file Miner_config.cfg write your username from duinocoin site: "username = username"

and I will suggest you NOT to change anything else in that file.

File Android_Miner.py - is a miner for android, that file along can mine you some coins.

File cluster_server.py - is a server for your cluster, it must have folder PCMiner_2.4_resources next to it(default port is 9090)

File Android_cluster.py - is a miner for cluster, don't forget to change server address, it doesn't need folder PCMiner_2.4_resources

ToDo:
Rewrite cluster

before you start program download some python libraries:

  py-cpuinfo

  colorama

  requests
  
  pypresence
  
  xxhash
