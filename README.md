# DuinoCoin miner optimized for phones under  OS android

To start it you can use any python ide, I suggest pydroid 3 or you can also use termux

in folder PCMiner_2.4_resources in file Miner_config.cfg write your username from duinocoin site: "username = username"

and I will suggest you NOT to change anything else in that file.

before you start program dowload some python libraries:

  py-cpuinfo

  colorama

  requests
  
  pypresence
  
  xxhash
